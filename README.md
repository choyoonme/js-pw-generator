# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## User Story

Using JavaScript we've learned this week: assign variables to arrays of strings that contain letters, numbers, and special characters; write prompts to determine chosen criteria for password through a series of prompts/confirms that follow if/else or ternary statements; write for loop to run through specified length and boolean data. Target the text area in the document to input password result using querySelector and innerText.

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```
