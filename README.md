# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## User Story

This week’s homework requires you to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they’ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include special characters. If you’re unfamiliar with these, see this [list of password special characters](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters) from the OWASP Foundation.

## User Story

Modify starter code to create an application that generates random secure passwords based on a selection of criteria: number of characters, lowercase/uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.


## Acceptance Criteria
Using JavaScript we've learned this week, write prompts to determine selected criteria through a series of prompts and alerts that follow if/else. Assign variables to arrays of strings that contain letters, numbers, and special characters. Write functions to return random characters falling within a min and max range using the getRandomInt. Use for/while loops to generate a matching number of characters.

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

## Mock-Up
